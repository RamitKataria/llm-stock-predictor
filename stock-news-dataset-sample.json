AI is changing the professional world at every level, including headshots. Headshots have been an essential part of an individual's digital resume since digital resumes became a thing, and in no place is this more true than LinkedIn. The professional networking site is an ideal place for a potential employer or collaborator to check out your background, so the picture you use matters. Although you can get impressive shots using a top camera phone, there's a difference between a quick selfie and a professional headshot."

    "description": "Mobile World Live brings you our top three picks of the week, as Sam Altman left and then agreed to return to OpenAI, BT Group entered into talks to acquire tech trade-in specialist musicMagpie and there were early signs of a recovery in the smartphone market. The post The Friday File: 5 days that shook OpenAI and a smartphone rebound appeared first on Mobile World Live. Mobile World Live brings you our top three picks of the week, as Sam Altman left and then agreed to return to OpenAI, BT Group entered into talks to acquire tech trade-in specialist musicMagpie and there were early signs of a recovery in the smartphone market. Altman set for swift OpenAI comeback What happened? In a tumultuous week for OpenAI, Sam Altman was removed as CEO by the company\u2019s board and subsequently handed a new role with Microsoft, before a dramatic u-turn saw the executive agree in principle to be reinstated as head of the generative AI heavyweight. Why it matters: Altman\u2019s initial removal was a major misstep by the company\u2019s board, resulting in threats of a mass exodus by staff and investor pressure to rectify the situation. While Altman will now return to the company under the supervision of a new board, some argue the damage to OpenAI\u2019s reputation may be permanent. Nick Patience of S&P Global Market Intelligence told BBC OpenAI can\u2019t be the same company anymore and the saga would have \u201cimplications not only for potential investors but also for recruitment\u201d. Related Articles AI & Cloud Altman set for swift OpenAI comeback By Chris Donkin BT in talks over swoop for second-hand tech dealer What happened? It emerged BT and investor Aurelius Group entered into preliminary talks to acquire musicMagpie, with the tech trade-in company setting a deadline of 18 December for firm buyout offers. Why it matters: Kester Mann, CCS Insight director consumer and connectivity, said BT\u2019s interest in a potential deal reflects the burgeoning market for second hand devices. He also noted its interest could be part of operator EE\u2019s new strategy to push harder into consumer electronics \u201cby offering a broader range of products to both existing and potential customers using a new digital platform\u201d.

Canalys research indicated early signs of a recovery in the smartphone market, forecasting a shipment decline of 5 per cent in 2023 compared to 12 per cent in 2022. In a full rebound, it expects growth of 4 per cent in 2024. Why it matters: Following years of gloom, senior analyst at Canalys Toby Zhu said the smartphone industry is \u201cclearly emerging from its darkest days\u201d. Softening decline in 2023 will be driven by a stronger rate of upgrades in emerging markets, while demand from Asia-Pacific in 2024 will be a key driver towards projected growth of the sector.
